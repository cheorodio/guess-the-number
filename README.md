<h2> An interactive guessing game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to generate a random number between 1 and 20 for users to try to guess. Different messages will appear based on the users guess. </h2>

<h3> Inspiration: </h3>
As a former kindergarten teacher, I am inspired to create a web app to aid students with their learning. The first project is the Guess my Number. Students will have to guess the hidden number between 1 and 20, they get 20 tries until it’s game over. The score starts from 20 and it goes down every time the guess is incorrect, the highest score will remain on the screen under “high score”. They can keep playing until they get a satisfied high score result.

<h3> Project Objective:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use JavaScript to generate a random number, which will be the hidden number that the Students need to guess.
</li>
<li>Change the message when students guess the correct number.
</li>
<li>Change the message when students guess it incorrectly.
</li>
<li>Change the message when students used up their 20 tries
</li>
<li>Return to default when students click the ‘try again’ button.
</li>
</ul>


This was my first project using JavaScript 🥳
